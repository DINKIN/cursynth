Start typing on your keyboard's home row to hear cursynth for the
first time.  Typing F1 or 'H' will show help and information.
.SS "2 Controls"
.IX Subsection "2 Controls"
cursynth is \s-1MIDI\s0 enabled so if you have a working \s-1MIDI\s0 keyboard or
controller, cursynth will respond to note/velocity/etc events and can
learn what parameters to change when a knob or slider is moved through
\&\s-1MIDI\s0 learn.

.SS "3 Synthesis"
.IX Subsection "3 Synthesis"
cursynth uses a very common form of synthesis called *Subtractive
Synthesis*.  There are three major components in cursynth's synthesis:
.PP
* Oscillators
* Filter
* Amplifier
.PP
Synthesis starts with the two oscillators that create the initial
sound.  The output of the two oscillators are mixed together and fed
into the envelope controlled filter.  The output of the filter is fed
into the envelope controlled amplifier.  Since cursynth is a polyphonic
synthesizer, there is a copy of each component (oscillator, filter,
amplifier) for each voice.  The output of all the voices are combined
into a single output that is fed into the delay line.
.SS "4 Oscillators"
.IX Subsection "4 Oscillators"
The initial sound creation in cursynth happens in the oscillators.
There are two oscillators and you can choose the wave type for each from
the 13 waveforms:
.PP
* sin
* triangle
* square
* down saw
* up saw
* three step
* four step
* eight step
* three pyramid
* five pyramid
* nine pyramid
* white noise
.PP
You can control the second oscillator's transpose relative to the
given note and fine tune the frequency using the tune parameter.
.PP
The two oscillators are hooked into a cross frequency modulation
cycle.  That is, oscillator 1 modifies the frequency of oscillator 2 and
oscillator 2 in turn modifies the frequency of oscillator 1.  Cross
modulation greatly expands the types of sounds you can get from the
oscillators.
.PP
The output of the two oscillators are mixed together using a ratio
definted by the 'oscillator mix' parameter.  A value of 0.5 mixes the
oscillators equally.  A value of 0.0 is only the first oscillator, A
value of 1.0 is only oscillator 2.
.SS "5 Filter"
.IX Subsection "5 Filter"
cursynth has a resonant filter for each voice.  This filter can either
be a low-pass or high-pass filter.
.PP
You can positively or negatively keytrack the filter so that higher
notes will have a higher cutoff and lower notes will have a lower
cutoff.
.PP
The filter also has an \s-1ADSR\s0 envelope that controls the filter cutoff.
It can also be routed to other things using the modulation matrix.
.SS "6 Amplifier"
.IX Subsection "6 Amplifier"
cursynth has an amplifier that is controlled by an \s-1ADSR\s0 amplifier.  You
can also velocity track the notes so the faster you hit a note on a \s-1MIDI\s0
keyboard, the bigger the amplitude of the voice will be.
.SS "7 Modulation Matrix"
.IX Subsection "7 Modulation Matrix"
cursynth has a modulation matrix so you can add custom modulation to
cursynth's routing.  For example, you can set an \s-1LFO\s0 as the source and
the pitch as a destination with a small modulation scale to create a
vibrato.
.PP
There are five fields for five separate modulation settings.
.SS "8 Effects"
.IX Subsection "8 Effects"
cursynth currently has a single delay effect.  The audio of all the
synth voices are combined into one signal that is passed into the delay
effect.
.PP
You can control the feedback amount and delay time.
.SS "9 Articulation"
.IX Subsection "9 Articulation"
cursynth has a number of controls that change how it acts as a
synthesizer.
.PP
* polyphony
* legato
* portamento
* portamento type
* pitch bend range
.PP
polyphony controls the maximum number of active voices at any time.
.PP
legato controls what happens when a note overrides a currently active
note because we had too many active voices.  'off' will cause the note
to retrigger, restarting all oscillators, envelopes and LFOs.  'on' will
not retrigger any oscillators, envelopes or LFOs but will set the
frequency to the new note.
.PP
portamento controls how long it takes to slide the frequency from one
note to another note.  cursynth has a linear (in semitones) slide
measured in seconds-per-octave.
.PP
portamento type controls when the notes slide.  When 'off' notes
never slide their frequency.  When 'on' notes always slide their
frequency.  When 'auto' notes slide only when the note that is being
overridden is still held down on the keyboard, that is will jump to the
new frequency immediately if the overridden note was already released.
.PP
pitch bend range controls how much the pitch wheel affects the pitch
of all the voices, measured in semitones.
.SS "10 Patches"
.IX Subsection "10 Patches"
cursynth is a synthesizer that can make a variety of different sounds
through different settings.  You can save to, and load these settings
from cursynth patches.
.PP
To load, press 'L' (shift + 'l'), then select from the patch list.
You can test the patch by playing on your keyboard.  When you decide on
a patch, press enter to finish loading.
.PP
To save, press 'S' (shift + 's'), then name your patch and hit enter.
The patch will save to \f(CW$HOME\fR/.cursynth/patches/
.PP
All cursynth patches have a .mite extensions and there are two
locations where cursynth looks for them:
.PP
* a system data share directory, (usually
/usr/local/share/cursynth/patches/)
* \f(CW$HOME\fR/.cursynth/patches/
.PP
Patches are also human readable so you can edit them with your text
editor if you wish.

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document \*(L"free\*(R" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or
noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
.PP
This License is a kind of \*(L"copyleft\*(R", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
It complements the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
.PP
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference.
.PP
1. \s-1APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\s0
.PP
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
\&\*(L"Document\*(R", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \*(L"you\*(R".  You accept
the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
requiring permission under copyright law.
.PP
A \*(L"Modified Version\*(R" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
.PP
A \*(L"Secondary Section\*(R" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.
.PP
The \*(L"Invariant Sections\*(R" are certain Secondary Sections whose
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
any Invariant Sections then there are none.
.PP
The \*(L"Cover Texts\*(R" are certain short passages of text that are
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
be at most 25 words.
.PP
A \*(L"Transparent\*(R" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
\&\*(L"Transparent\*(R" is called \*(L"Opaque\*(R".
.PP
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
\&\s-1SGML\s0 or \s-1XML\s0 using a publicly available \s-1DTD,\s0 and standard-conforming
simple \s-1HTML,\s0 PostScript or \s-1PDF\s0 designed for human modification.
Examples of transparent image formats include \s-1PNG, XCF\s0 and \s-1JPG.\s0
Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
edited only by proprietary word processors, \s-1SGML\s0 or \s-1XML\s0 for which
the \s-1DTD\s0 and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
the machine-generated \s-1HTML,\s0 PostScript or \s-1PDF\s0 produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
.PP
The \*(L"Title Page\*(R" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \*(L"Title
Page\*(R" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
.PP
A section \*(L"Entitled \s-1XYZ\*(R"\s0 means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely \s-1XYZ\s0 or contains \s-1XYZ\s0 in parentheses
following text that translates \s-1XYZ\s0 in another language.  (Here \s-1XYZ\s0
stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
\&\*(L"Acknowledgements\*(R", \*(L"Dedications\*(R", \*(L"Endorsements\*(R", or \*(L"History\*(R".)
To \*(L"Preserve the Title\*(R" of such a section when you modify the
Document means that it remains a section \*(L"Entitled \s-1XYZ\*(R"\s0 according
to this definition.
.PP
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
has no effect on the meaning of this License.
.PP
2. \s-1VERBATIM COPYING\s0
.PP
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
conditions in section 3.
.PP
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
and you may publicly display copies.
.PP
3. \s-1COPYING IN QUANTITY\s0
.PP
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
.PP
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
adjacent pages.
.PP
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard
network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
.PP
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.
.PP
4. \s-1MODIFICATIONS\s0
.PP
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
the Modified Version:
.PP
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
as a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission.
.PP
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
from this requirement.
.PP
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.
.PP
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
.PP
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.
.PP
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
the Addendum below.
.PP
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
license notice.
.PP
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
.PP
I. Preserve the section Entitled \*(L"History\*(R", Preserve its Title,
and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled \*(L"History\*(R" in the
Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
previous sentence.
.PP
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
likewise the network locations given in the Document for
previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
\&\*(L"History\*(R" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
that was published at least four years before the Document
itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
to gives permission.
.PP
K. For any section Entitled \*(L"Acknowledgements\*(R" or \*(L"Dedications\*(R",
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
.PP
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
.PP
M. Delete any section Entitled \*(L"Endorsements\*(R".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.
.PP
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
\&\*(L"Endorsements\*(R" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
Section.
.PP
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
.PP
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
section titles.
.PP
You may add a section Entitled \*(L"Endorsements\*(R", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties\*(--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
definition of a standard.
.PP
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
the old one.
.PP
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
.PP
5. \s-1COMBINING DOCUMENTS\s0
.PP
You may combine the Document with other documents released under
this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
their Warranty Disclaimers.
.PP
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work.
.PP
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
\&\*(L"History\*(R" in the various original documents, forming one section
Entitled \*(L"History\*(R"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
\&\*(L"Acknowledgements\*(R", and any sections Entitled \*(L"Dedications\*(R".  You
must delete all sections Entitled \*(L"Endorsements.\*(R"
.PP
6. \s-1COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\s0
.PP
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
in all other respects.
.PP
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.
.PP
7. \s-1AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\s0
.PP
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an \*(L"aggregate\*(R" if the
copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
.PP
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
the whole aggregate.
.PP
8. \s-1TRANSLATION\s0
.PP
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
include the original English version of this License and the
original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of
this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.
.PP
If a section in the Document is Entitled \*(L"Acknowledgements\*(R",
\&\*(L"Dedications\*(R", or \*(L"History\*(R", the requirement (section 4) to
Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
actual title.
.PP
9. \s-1TERMINATION\s0
.PP
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
.PP
10. \s-1FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\s0
.PP
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
the \s-1GNU\s0 Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.
.PP
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
version of this License \*(L"or any later version\*(R" applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that specified version or of any later version that has been
published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
Software Foundation.
.PP
A.1 \s-1ADDENDUM:\s0 How to use this License for your documents
========================================================
.PP
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:
.PP
Copyright (C)  \s-1YEAR  YOUR NAME.\s0
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the \s-1GNU\s0 Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``\s-1GNU\s0
Free Documentation License''.
.PP
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the \*(L"with...Texts.\*(R"  line with this:
.PP
with the Invariant Sections being \s-1LIST THEIR TITLES,\s0 with
the Front-Cover Texts being \s-1LIST,\s0 and with the Back-Cover Texts
being \s-1LIST.\s0
.PP
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
.PP
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
